## Mapbox and How We are Using It
## Setting Up Your Environment (For New Developers)
New Developers will need [Unity version 2020.3.34f1](https://unity.com/releases/editor/whats-new/2020.3.34) with a seperately downloaded [Gradle version 7.5.1](https://gradle.org/releases/). This section is purely meant to walk new developers through setting up their unity environment for development of this project.
> [!WARNING]
> If gradle is not set correctly, project will __not__ build on your computer, regardless of other settings!

## How It Works! (Right Now)
## What is Lightship AR? How do I work it?
> [!NOTE]
> Developers who wish to become even more intimately familiar with this project can read the Lightship ARDK 2.5 documentation [here](https://lightship.dev/docs/archive/ardk/).
## Mapbox and How We are Using It
## Setting Up Your Environment (For New Developers)
New Developers will need [Unity version 2020.3.34f1](https://unity.com/releases/editor/whats-new/2020.3.34) with a seperately downloaded [Gradle version 7.5.1](https://gradle.org/releases/). This section is purely meant to walk new developers through setting up their unity environment for development of this project.
> [!WARNING]
> If gradle is not set correctly, project will __not__ build on your computer, regardless of other settings!

## App UI
> Home Screen Scrolling:
>   Panels exist in a "grid" where each space is the size of the screen. A swipe between pages moves the entire grid across the camera space so that a new panel
>   become visible.
> Tag Gallery:
>   Dynamically creates tag thumbnails in a flowing grid (similar to something like an instagram profile). Tag information is loaded from a filler dataset right now.
>   Awaiting server implementation
